						<p style="margin-top:4px;">As Chair, I look forward to working with my fellow board members to grow the YPT SF Bay Area community and put on programs that are fun, educational, and relevant to you, our members. Career-wise, I am passionate about using strategic communications to advance progressive transportation policy. After spending some time in the public sector, I recently took on a new role at Veo, the only woman-founded micromobility company. In my spare time, I enjoy biking around Golden Gate Park and teaching tricks to my Golden Retriever, Izzy.</p>

						<p style="margin-top:4px;">I am the Deputy Chair and former Chair of YPT’s SF Bay Area Chapter. I’m excited to help lead the chapter after a quiet 2021 and connect transportation professionals all over the Bay with fun and educational events. Currently, I work for the City of San Jose, where I manage the city’s shared micromobility program and make bike and scooter share more accessible for everyone. Lately, you can find me shuttling my partner and new Border Collie puppy around on our cargo bike.</p>

						<p style="margin-top:4px;">Hi all - I am thrilled to be continuing as YPT SF Bay's Vice Chair for Finance for the second year in a row. I hope to build on my experience in the role and help the board do some exciting things this year. I moved to the Bay Area 9 years ago and currently work as an engineer for the SFMTA. My work focuses on transit signal priority, signal timing, and other transit-supportive engineering work. When I'm not nerding out about transportation, I enjoy cooking, reading and writing science fiction, and hiking with my dog (a corgi mix named Cowboy).</p>

						<p style="margin-top:4px;">Hello! I was on the board last year as the Vice Chair of Membership, which Nicholette will be serving as this year. In my new position as Vice Chair for Administration, my goals are to be in the larger YPT conversations such as deciding how funding is distributed to regional and local chapters, better connecting our local chapter to the southwest region and YPT International, and streamlining our internal process for organizing events and reporting back our activities to YPT. I currently work at Fehr &amp; Peers where I get to solve complex problems across the Bay Area with some pretty talented, passionate, and dedicated colleagues. Outside of work I enjoy visiting parks and exploring local coffee shops.</p>

I recently joined the board as the Vice Chair for Communications, and I hope to serve in this capacity bringing the latest news and up-to-date occurrences in our organization. I love to watch videos, cook, sleep and go for strolls in my pastime.</p>

						<p style="margin-top:4px;">I’m super excited to be serving on this year’s board. I recently moved to Oakland, and am currently working at Fehr &amp; Peers as a Transportation Planner. In transportation, I’m really interested in safety especially in bicycle and pedestrian planning, as well as planning more equitable cities. I’m looking forward to hosting exciting events and getting more people involved with the San Francisco Bay Area YPT chapter, and increasing our membership numbers! I like to spend my free time exploring Oakland and San Francisco, and spending sunny days out with friends.</p>
